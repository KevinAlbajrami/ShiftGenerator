This is a very basic shift generator application. The data exists in a mysql database in the form of "TIMESTAMP : 1(working) / 0( not working). With UI in JAVAFX, the application prompts the user to select interested dates, and set shift hours (with a button to apply shift to all similar days). The data (usually in large size (>1 million lines)) is then read using APACHE POI and split into normal shift hours and overtime hours. Excel files are produce for each. The application is to be finalized (remove the blank lines create from picking specific rows from all data).
While this solution is not speed efficent, it is highly memory efficent.
